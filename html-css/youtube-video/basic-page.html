        <p>Puschkinia scilloides is a small bulbous plant, 
            growing to about 10–15 cm (4–6 in) tall. It has two narrow basal leaves that widen 
            towards the tips (oblanceolate). The inflorescence appears in early spring and is
            a dense raceme with up to 20 flowers. The flowers are pale blue with a darker blue
            line in the centre of each tepal. A characteristic of the genus Puschkinia is a 
            small cup surrounding the stamens and style.</p> <!-- Detailed description of the plant -->
